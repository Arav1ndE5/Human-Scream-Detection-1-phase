Hey,

    Human Scream Detection model aims to detect screams of distress and alert nearby officers and helps in reduce crime rate.
    open "main.ipynb" file to run the model.


    note - 

        This DNN model currently doesnot account for shouting or high pitch sounds.
        Hence for further improvements 2 more phases of seperation are to be included:
            1. Screams from Shouts
            2. Screams from High pitch noises.

    -for more improvements we must also differentiate between human sound and surrounding noises-
