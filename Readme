Hey,
    This DNN model currently doesnot account for shouting or high pitch sounds.
    Hence for further improvements 2 more phases of seperation are to be included:
        1. Screams from Shouts
        2. Screams from High pitch noises.

    -for more improvements we must also differentiate between human sound and surrounding noises-
